Feature: Performance Monitoring\n  As a game developer\n  I want to monitor rendering performance across different layers\n  So that I can identify and optimize performance bottlenecks\n\n  Background:\n    Given I have a performance monitor\n    And performance tracking is enabled\n\n  Scenario: Frame timing is tracked correctly\n    Given I start a new frame\n    When I begin rendering the \"TERRAIN\" layer\n    And the TERRAIN rendering takes 5ms\n    When I begin rendering the \"ENTITIES\" layer  \n    And the ENTITIES rendering takes 10ms\n    When I begin rendering the \"UI_GAME\" layer\n    And the UI_GAME rendering takes 3ms\n    And I complete the frame\n    Then the total frame time should be approximately 18ms\n    And the layer breakdown should show \"TERRAIN: 5ms, ENTITIES: 10ms, UI_GAME: 3ms\"\n\n  Scenario: Performance warnings for slow frames\n    Given I start a new frame\n    When I begin rendering the \"ENTITIES\" layer\n    And the ENTITIES rendering takes 25ms\n    And I complete the frame\n    Then the frame should be marked as \"SLOW\"\n    And a performance warning should be generated\n\n  Scenario: Entity statistics tracking\n    Given I have 100 total entities\n    And 85 entities are rendered\n    And 15 entities are culled\n    When I record the entity statistics\n    Then the culling efficiency should be 15%\n    And the render efficiency should be 85%\n\n  Scenario: Memory usage monitoring\n    Given I start monitoring memory usage\n    When I create 50 new particle effects\n    And I complete the frame\n    Then the memory usage should increase\n    And particle count should be 50
