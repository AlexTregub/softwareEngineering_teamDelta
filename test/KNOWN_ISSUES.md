## Issues Status

### Fixed ✅

- [x] **DraggablePanel: Boundary Detection Bug**
  - File: `Classes/systems/ui/DraggablePanel.js`
  - Issue: Off-by-one errors in `isPointInBounds()` method
  - Tests: 15 passing unit tests

- [x] **GridTerrain & CustomTerrain: imageMode Mismatch (0.5-Tile Offset)**
  - Files: `Classes/terrainUtils/gridTerrain.js`, `Classes/terrainUtils/CustomTerrain.js`
  - Issue: Grid/terrain visual misalignment in main game and Level Editor
  - Tests: 7 unit + 28 integration + 2 E2E tests passing

- [x] **Grid Coordinate System: Y-Axis Span Boundary Check Bug**
  - File: `Classes/terrainUtils/grid.js` (line ~185)
  - Issue: `get()` method incorrectly rejects valid Y-coordinate queries
  - Priority: HIGH
  - Workaround: Use `MapManager.getTileAtGridCoords()` instead of `Grid.get()`
  - Tests Needed: Unit + integration tests for inverted Y-axis spans

- [x] **Level Editor: Select Tool & Hover Preview**
  - Files: `Classes/ui/SelectionManager.js`, `Classes/ui/HoverPreviewManager.js`, `Classes/systems/ui/LevelEditor.js`
  - Feature: Select tool for rectangle selection + hover preview for all tools
  - Implemented: Click-drag rectangle selection, paint all tiles under selection, hover highlights affected tiles
  - Tests: 19 unit + 13 integration + 4 E2E tests passing

- [x] **Level Editor Material Palette: Material Names Truncated**
  - File: `Classes/ui/MaterialPalette.js` (line 285)
  - Issue: Material names were truncated to 4 characters (e.g., "stone" appeared as "ston")
  - Priority: LOW (cosmetic)
  - Fix: Removed `.substring(0, 4)` truncation, now renders full material names
  - Tests: 10 unit tests passing

### Open ❌

- [ ] **Level Editor: Zoom Focus Point Incorrect**
  - File: `Classes/systems/ui/LevelEditor.js` (handleZoom method)
  - Issue: When zooming with mouse wheel in Level Editor, zoom doesn't focus on mouse pointer correctly
  - Priority: MEDIUM (UX)
  - Expected: Zoom should focus on mouse cursor position (like PLAYING state does)
  - Current: Zoom focuses on incorrect point, not following mouse cursor
  - Note: PLAYING state zoom works correctly via cameraManager
  - Root Cause: Level Editor uses center-based scaling transform while CameraManager uses simple transform
  - Tests Needed: Integration test comparing zoom behavior between states

- [ ] **Level Editor: Paint Tool Offset When Zoomed**
  - File: `Classes/systems/ui/LevelEditor.js` (applyCameraTransform, convertScreenToWorld)
  - Issue: When zoomed in/out, painted tiles appear far from mouse cursor position
  - Priority: HIGH (blocks Level Editor usage)
  - Expected: Tiles paint exactly where mouse cursor is positioned
  - Current: Tiles paint at offset location (e.g., mouse bottom-left, tile paints top-left)
  - Root Cause: Transform mismatch between rendering (applyCameraTransform) and mouse coordinate conversion (screenToWorld)
  - Reproduction: Zoom to any level != 1.0, try to paint - tiles appear offset from cursor
  - Tests Needed: Integration test verifying screenToWorld matches applyCameraTransform inverse
