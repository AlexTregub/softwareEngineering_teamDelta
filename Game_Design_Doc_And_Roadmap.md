- **Pheromones System**
    **Summary**: Indirect control system for allied ants, emitted by queens and buildings which will disperse outwards.
    Pheromones can tell ants to Follow, Attack, Build, Gather. Ants will tend to follow pheromone trails.
    Pheromones should disperse after enough time, Ants will follow the strongest Pheromones they can "smell",
    unless expressly overwritten (Not sure how or if this is true, im guessing.)
